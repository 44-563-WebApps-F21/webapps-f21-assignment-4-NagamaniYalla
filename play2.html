<h5>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>  
<p>There is some one.  There are lights in the room,
and the door is ajar.  Some one has been listening to every secret of my
life.  Arthur, what does this mean?</p>

<h5>LORD GORING</h5>  
<p>Robert, you are excited, unnerved.  I tell you there is no
one in that room. Sit down, Robert.</p>

<h5>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>  
<p>If there is no one there why should I not look in
that room?  Arthur, you must let me go into that room and satisfy myself.
Let me know that no eavesdropper has heard my life’s secret.  Arthur, you
don’t realise what I am going through.</p>I

<h5>LORD GORING</h5>  
<p>Robert, this must stop.  I have told you that there is no
one in that room—that is enough.</p>

<h5>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h5>  
<p class="stage-direction">[_Rushes to the door of the room_.]</p>
<p>It is not enough.  I insist on going into this room.  You have told me there is no
one there, so what reason can you have for refusing me?</p>

<h5>MRS. CHEVELEY</h5>  
<p class="stage-direction" >_With a mock curtsey_]</p>
<p>Good evening, Lord Goring!</p>
