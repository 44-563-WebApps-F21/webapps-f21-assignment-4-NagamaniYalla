    <h5>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> <p8>Arthur, you must let me stay for five minutes.  I
    have made up my mind what I am going to do to-night in the House.  The
    debate on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven.  <p>[_A chair falls in
    the drawing-room_.]</p>  What is that?</p8>

    <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <p9>Nothing.</p9>

    <h5>SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>  <p10>I heard a chair fall in the next room.  Some one
    has been listening.</p10>
