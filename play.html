PHIPPS.  [_Hands hock and seltzer to_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  Hock and
seltzer, sir.
<br>
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thank you.
<br>
LORD GORING.  Is your carriage here, Robert?
<br>
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  No; I walked from the club.
<br>
LORD GORING.  Sir Robert will take my cab, Phipps.
<br>
PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Exit_.]
<br>
LORD GORING.  Robert, you don’t mind my sending you away?
<br>
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, you must let me stay for five minutes.  I
have made up my mind what I am going to do to-night in the House.  The
debate on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven.  [_A chair falls in
the drawing-room_.]  What is that?
<br>
LORD GORING.  Nothing.
<br>
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I heard a chair fall in the next room.  Some one
has been listening.
<br>
LORD GORING.  No, no; there is no one there.
